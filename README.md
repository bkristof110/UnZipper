# UnZipper
Simple C# program to unzip many zip files at once.

## How it works
It always creates a new folder with the name of the zip file.
It can take two arguments, the first is a path to the zip files and the second is the path to the folder where they will be unzipped to.

It's handy when you have many small zip files that have to be unzipped into separate folders.
